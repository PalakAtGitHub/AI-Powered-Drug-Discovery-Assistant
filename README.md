# 💊 KPGT Drug Assistant: An AI-Powered Drug Discovery Platform  

## 🚀 Overview  
KPGT Drug Assistant is an innovative **AI-based platform** designed to streamline and enhance the **drug discovery process**. Leveraging **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **molecular descriptors**, it evaluates potential drug candidates based on:  

- 🧬 **Chemical properties** (via SMILES strings)  
- ⚗️ **Molecular fingerprints & descriptors**  
- 🧠 **Predictions from fine-tuned models** (powered by the LiGhT architecture)  
- ☣️ **Toxicity, efficacy, and drug-likeness**  
- 🔁 **Drug-drug interaction predictions**
