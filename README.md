Overview:
KPGT Drug Assistant is an innovative AI-based platform designed to streamline and enhance the drug discovery process. Leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) and molecular descriptors, it evaluates potential drug candidates by analyzing:

🧬 Chemical properties (via SMILES strings)
⚗️ Molecular fingerprints & descriptors
🧠 Predictions from fine-tuned models (powered by the LiGhT architecture)
☣️ Toxicity, efficacy, and drug-likeness
🔁 Drug-drug interaction predictions

Key Features:
🚀 Fast Predictions: Upload or input a SMILES string to instantly receive drug analysis.
📊 Rich Visualization: Graphical representation of molecular structure, feature importance, and prediction confidence.
🧠 GNN-Powered Intelligence: Uses the LiGhT (Lightweight Graph Transformer) model for accurate molecule property prediction.
🌐 User-Friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive UI to help researchers and students explore chemical compounds effectively.
